# Requirements:
**Recommended Tip:** Create a [virtual environment](https://github.com/arjun0108/django-tricks/blob/master/README.md#working-with-virtual-environment) so that you don't mess up your other projects.

Install all the required packages:
```console
pip install -r requirements/local.txt
```
